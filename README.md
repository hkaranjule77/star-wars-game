# STAR WARS(TM) Game

#### Computer Graphics Project
#### Programming Language: C Language

# Introduction
It is a game with theme based on first released movie of STAR WARS.
This theme was suggested by my close friend *Gaurav Garmode*.

There are three ships kinds of ship -
1) X-Wings (Player's Ship)
2) Tie-figher (Enemy's Ship)
3) Darth Vader's Tie-fighter (Final Enemy's Ship)

Like movie, Luke Skywalker's planet is invaded by Deathstar.
So he starts his journey towards it, fights with Tie-fighers and 
for destroying Deathstar.

Hence, Game starts with the Luke Skywalker's ship(player) entering the
Screen which is invaded by Tie-fighter(enemy) in space. When player 
destroys all Tie-fighers, he/she is able to go close to the Death star's 
surface and there needs to face some other tie-fighers again
 with surprise entry of Darth Vader's ship with 
special endurance.  
Finally, player has fire laser into the hole of Deathstar to destroy it.
